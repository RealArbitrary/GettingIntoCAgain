<h1>Program Flow Mastery</h1>
<p>Started my journey in the console again: The goal of this application is to entirely master program flow before
    getting into more advanced web applications</p>
<p>Preparation is key to me, and I believe if I am well prepared for the web than the journey goes much smoother.</p>
<div>
    I want to prove with a simple console application that my program flow knowledge is exceptional.
    This application is built and maintained in free time only. I am committed to doing something worth implementing
    every single day (where possible) to speed up my delivery and learning curve.
